# translate

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-23 09:08 EDT

Add English translations to non-English CHAT transcripts by injecting a
`%xtra` tier after each utterance. Text-only — no audio involved.

## Engine

Two backends are available:

- **Google Translate** (`googletrans`) — calls the public Google Translate
  endpoint. Requires outbound reachability to `translate.google.com`;
  unsuitable for hosts behind the Great Firewall unless a VPN is active.
  Rate-limited to one item per 1.5 seconds inside the worker. **Default.**
- **Meta SeamlessM4T** (`facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-medium`) — runs locally
  in the Python worker. Model is downloaded from HuggingFace on first use
  and cached thereafter; no outbound network at inference time. Runs
  unthrottled.

Select with `--translate-engine google|seamless`. Default is Google.
Operators on hosts where Google Translate is unreachable pass
`--translate-engine seamless` explicitly per invocation (a shell alias
is the right place to make that persistent for a given user) — there is
no per-host config file knob for engine selection, by design.

For symmetry with how ASR and FA engines are selected, the shared
`--engine-overrides '{"translate":"<engine>"}'` global flag also
works and takes precedence over `--translate-engine`.

### Migrating from BA2

BA2 read the translation engine from `~/.batchalign.ini`:

```ini
[translate]
engine = seamless_translate
```

BA3 does not honor that key. The replacement is the explicit CLI flag
`--translate-engine seamless` (or the shared
`--engine-overrides '{"translate":"seamless"}'`). If you previously
relied on the INI entry for routine runs, drop the line from
`~/.batchalign.ini` and add the flag to whatever wrapper or alias you
invoke `batchalign3 translate` through.

## Re-running on already-translated files

Running `translate` on a file that already has `%xtra` tiers will
**overwrite** them with fresh output. This is a deliberate change from
batchalign2, which preserved the first translation and skipped any
utterance that already had one. If you want to keep prior translations,
copy the file first or filter your inputs.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Translate a single file in place — source language is read from @Languages
batchalign3 translate file.cha

# Translate a corpus directory
batchalign3 translate corpus/ -o translated/

# Use the remote server
batchalign3 --server http://your-server:8001 translate corpus/ -o out/
```

`translate` has **no `--lang` flag**. Source language for each file is
read from that file's own `@Languages:` header. Translation target is
fixed to English. To "override" the source language, edit the file's
`@Languages:` line.

## Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start([translate invoked]) --> parse[Parse all files → ASTs]
    parse --> collect[collect_payloads\nExtract utterance text + source/target language]
    collect --> worker[execute_v2(task="translate")\nprepared_text batch → raw translations]
    worker --> inject[inject %xtra tiers with translated text]
    inject --> merge_check{--merge-abbrev?}
    merge_check -->|Yes| merge[merge_abbreviations]
    merge_check -->|No| serialize
    merge --> serialize[Serialize → .cha output]
    serialize --> done([Output .cha files])
```

Translation results are not cached: the `CacheTaskName` enum (at
`crates/batchalign/src/chat_ops/cache_key.rs:58`) only has
`ForcedAlignment` and `UtrAsr` variants, and `translate.rs` does not
call `cache.put`. Repeated `translate` runs on the same input
re-invoke the worker.

## Options

### Path options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PATHS...` | Input `.cha` files or directories |
| `-o`, `--output DIR` | Output directory (omit to overwrite in place) |
| `--file-list FILE` | Read input paths from a text file |
| `--in-place` | Explicit in-place flag |

### translate options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--translate-engine google\|seamless` | `google` | Pick the translation engine for this invocation |
| `--merge-abbrev` / `--no-merge-abbrev` | off | Merge abbreviations in the translated output |

---

## Failure modes

batchalign3 translate fails fast on engine failures rather than emitting
partial output. When the worker reports a per-utterance error (engine
network failure, GFW block on Google, rate-limit exhaustion, model
runtime error), the affected file is marked failed with a typed
`ItemErrors` message naming the first few offending items and the
total count. Other files in the same batch continue normally — one
bad file does not poison the rest (BA2-parity multi-file semantics).

The output `.cha` for a failed file is **not** written. There is no
silent path where a job appears successful but produced a `.cha`
with missing `%xtra` tiers — if a tier is missing, the job result
will say so.

### Common cases

| Situation | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Google Translate unreachable (GFW block, network outage, DNS failure) | File marked failed with `translate failed for N item(s): item 0: Translation failed: ConnectionResetError ...`. Use `--translate-engine seamless` for hosts where Google is unreliable. |
| Rate-limit (429) on one or more items | File marked failed citing the 429 message verbatim. Retry; if persistent, switch to Seamless or split the workload. |
| Seamless first-download (HuggingFace) fails | File marked failed with the underlying HF error. If on a host where the default HF endpoint is slow, set `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` before the worker starts. |
| googletrans library import error in a stripped venv | Worker startup fails (loud), not a per-job failure. |

## What changes in the `.cha` file

- A `%xtra:` tier is added after each utterance containing the English
  translation
- All other tiers (`%mor`, `%gra`, `%wor`) are preserved unchanged
- No audio is involved
